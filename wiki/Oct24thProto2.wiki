Change in plans to shift towards goals that we can reasonably accomplish.

= Project scope changes =

VMWare and VMPearl-
     VMPearl Is not actually installed on the servers

     We were granted access to the lab

     Creating a preliminary list of data that is believed to be retrievable from VMWare. Then designing a series of test to determine whether or not the information is retrievable.

Broader role specific scope changes -
     Internal Data Structures - Individual - Archana
          'Dummy' Parsable document complete
          Edits to be made for whether or not data from VMWare will be retrievable
          Defined Language - Java


     VMWare data retrieval into a parsable file - Individual - Grant
          New access to lab
          Learning to launch VMWare
          Figure out what we can retrieve
          Installing VMPearl

     Graphical User Interface - Team of two - Brett and Tannis
          Prototype 2 - Java with Jung library
          Intergrate Java API
          

     Group congregation work
          GUI and API intergration
          Utilizing Java Data API with dummy document
          System Requirements (Java and compatibility of what VMWare runs on top of)
          Preliminary System Design Specifications
          Eclipse Java tracker
          
Time frame -
Wednesday Oct 31st for functional prototype 2
     Using Jung Library to speed development
     Test with the dummy parsable document
     Write out System Requirements (For Java - Jung and VMWare and potentially data api)
TBD Meeting with more group members at Radical lab
     Understand VMWare and data retrievable
     Learn to launch VMWare and it's compatibilites
